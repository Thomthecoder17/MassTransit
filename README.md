# MassTransit

## Description:
Redoing TTracker, but with the goal of tracking the ENTIRETY of MA transit.  
(Yes, even Cross-Acton Transit, the weird MWRTA routes, 128 THE GRID in and around Waltham, and Lexington's buses)  

## Demo:
The demo tends to be a bit finicky. You may have to close and re-open the app after granting it location services for the app to work properly.
